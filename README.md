# ðŸ’Ž Rune-page-project ðŸ’Ž 

Practice project using Express, RESTful API, MySql and DOM.

Intended purpose was to create a small complementary website for League of Legends, where the user can save their preferred pre-game settings, as the base game does not provide enough save slots.

Will recreate the site later with more advanced technologies.
